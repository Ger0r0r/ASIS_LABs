Warning: Power analysis is disabled for scenario 'norm.ffgnp0p88vm40c.rcbest_CCbest' as leakage/swcap/internal mode power app options can be off and/or leakage_power/dynamic_power scenario flags are set to false. (POW-009)
Warning: Power analysis is disabled for scenario 'norm.ssgnp0p72v125c.rcworst_CCworst' as leakage/swcap/internal mode power app options can be off and/or leakage_power/dynamic_power scenario flags are set to false. (POW-009)
Information: Doing activity propagation for mode 'norm.tt0p8v85c.typical_CCworst' and corner 'norm.tt0p8v85c.typical_CCworst' with effort level 'medium'. (POW-024)
Information: Timer-derived activity data is cached on scenario norm.tt0p8v85c.typical_CCworst (POW-052)
Infomation: Fast mode activity propagation power.rtl_activity_annotation setup is ignored. Always use accurate mode.
